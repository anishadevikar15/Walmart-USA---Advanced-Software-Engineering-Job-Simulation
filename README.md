## 🔹 Overview

During this experience, I worked on multiple technical tasks that reflect real industry challenges, including:

- Designing and implementing custom data structures in Java  
- Creating scalable system architectures using UML class diagrams  
- Modeling normalized relational databases using ER diagrams  
- Building a Python ETL pipeline to integrate and store shipping data in a centralized SQLite database

## 🔹 Key Tasks & Implementations

### 1. Custom Heap Data Structure (Java)
- Implemented a novel power-of-two max heap where each parent node has 2^k children.  
- Optimized insert and pop-max operations.  
- Focused on performance, scalability, and clean object-oriented design.

### 2. Data Processor System Design (UML)
- Designed a dynamically configurable data processor.  
- Applied Strategy and Factory design patterns.  
- Supported multiple processing modes and database connectors.

### 3. Database Design (ERD)
- Designed a normalized relational database for Walmart’s pet department.  
- Modeled products, customers, transactions, and shipments.  
- Focused on extensibility and data integrity.

### 4. Data Integration & ETL Pipeline (Python + SQLite)
- Developed a Python script to read data from multiple spreadsheets.  
- Merged dependent datasets and normalized records.  
- Inserted cleaned data into an SQLite database for centralized querying and analytics.
